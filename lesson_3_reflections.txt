When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository is extremely helpful when working in teams. People can access
    each others work and keep on working even when not connected to the internet.
    Also, even when working alone, a remote repository is a nice way to backup
    the work done. Certain git repository hosting services such as Github,
    Gitlab and Bitbucket offer a nice UI to manage and visualize the
    repository and the overall project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
