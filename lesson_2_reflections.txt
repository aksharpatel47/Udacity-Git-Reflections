What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git starts tracking files inside the directory where the repository is
  initialized. This is done to enable git version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  Staging area is an extremely well-thought-of concept. This allows the user
  to only add the files to the commit that are required. In the absence
  of this concept, all the changes in the working directory whether
  they be logically related or not are commit to the revision. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  If the project on which we are working on, has a lot of changes throughtout,
  we'll start by adding files to the staging area which are logically related
  to a single change and leave out the rest to be in the working directory
  for the time being. Ince we inspect using git diff --staged and are 
  satisfied what the correct files are in the staging area, we commit
  the files in the staging area to the version control repository.
