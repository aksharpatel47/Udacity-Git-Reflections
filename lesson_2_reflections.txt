What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git starts tracking files inside the directory where the repository is
  initialized. This is done to enable git version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  Staging area is an extremely well-thought-of concept. This allows the user
  to only add the files to the commit that are required. In the absence
  of this concept, all the changes in the working directory whether
  they be logically related or not are commit to the revision. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  If the project on which we are working on, has a lot of changes throughtout,
  we'll start by adding files to the staging area which are logically related
  to a single change and leave out the rest to be in the working directory
  for the time being. Ince we inspect using git diff --staged and are 
  satisfied what the correct files are in the staging area, we commit
  the files in the staging area to the version control repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Lets say if we're working on a particular feature in a branch, and we want
  to fix a bug that has been found in the master branch, we can move to
  master branch and fix the bug. If we're working in a team of multiple
  developers, everyone working on the master branch can spell disaster.
  Hence, everyone can create their own branches from master and add
  their changes in the branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  Visualizing the branch structure through diagrams would help to understand
  the reachability of the commits and their state in comparison to the
  master branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

  The result of merging two branches together is a commit on the branch on which
  it was merged. This commit has reference to last commits in both the branches.
  This way, the commits in both the branches are accessible from the new commit.
  When we represent this by diagram, it allows us to understand at which point
  the branches were created and˝ what commits have been added in the branches
  before the merge happened.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
